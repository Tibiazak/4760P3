This program simulates an operating system enforcing mutual exclusion using message queues.

To run this program, compile by running: make all

then run ./oss [-s x] [-t z] -l filename
where x is the max number of processes to run, z is the length of time in real time seconds for the program to run,
and the filename is the name you would like the output file to save as.
